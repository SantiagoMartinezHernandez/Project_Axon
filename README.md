# Project Axon: The Distributed Neural Interface

**Axon** is a multimodal AI ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between biological signals and digital cognition. It functions as a distributed nervous system, leveraging Edge AI (TinyML), Mobile Computing (Flutter), and High-Performance Cloud/Local Inference (Gemini/V-JEPA).

## 🧠 The Architecture

### 1. The Core (Server)
* **Hardware:** NVIDIA RTX 4080 Workstation.
* **Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Gemini Multimodal Live API, Meta V-JEPA.
* **Role:** Complex reasoning, physics prediction, and holographic memory.

### 2. The Satellite (Gateway)
* **Hardware:** iPhone 14 Pro.
* **Stack:** Flutter (iOS), ARKit (LiDAR), WebSockets.
* **Role:** The "eyes and ears" of the system. Handles real-time audio/video streaming and depth sensing.

### 3. The Nerves (Peripheral)
* **Hardware:** Custom ART/Wear Hardware (ESP32-S3).
* **Stack:** C++, PlatformIO, TinyML.
* **Role:** Proprioception and haptic feedback. Calculates biological inferences at the edge.

## 🎯 Dual-Use Goals

* **Academic:** A platform for Psychophysics and Digital Neuroscience research (Latency-Action loops, Haptic Substitution).
* **Commercial:** R&D Sandbox for ART/Wear next-gen safety and sports performance products.
